- Implement:

	- A Serverless Endpoint 
		- Which takes in an email and a 'switchId=a41887ea-9672-4610-9439-a86b00c160e9' 
		- Sends an Email with the JSON content mashed up with a template engine of your choice
		- The JSON is taken from another API endpoint (https://rest.staging.energyhelpline.com/domestic/energy/switches/{switchId})
